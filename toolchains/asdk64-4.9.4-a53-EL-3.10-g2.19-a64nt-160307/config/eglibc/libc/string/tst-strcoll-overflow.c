/* Verify that strcoll does not crash for large strings for which it cannot
   cache weight lookup results.  The size is large enough to cause integer
   overflows on 32-bit as well as buffer overflows on 64-bit.  The test should
   work reasonably reliably when overcommit is disabled, but it obviously
   depends on how much memory the system has.  There's a limitation to this
   test in that it does not run to completion.  Actually collating such a
   large string can take days and we can't have xcheck running that long.  For
   that reason, we run the test for about 5 minutes and then assume that
   everything is fine if there are no crashes.  */
