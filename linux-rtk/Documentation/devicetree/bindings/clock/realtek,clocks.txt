Realtek Clock Controller
========================

Clock controllers for Realtek Platform

--------------
Clock Provider
--------------

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:

        "realtek,clock-controller" for Platform Clock Controller
	"realtek,tee-clock-controller" for TEE Clock Controller
        "realtek,clock-gate-controller" for Clock Gate Controller

- #clock-cells : shall contain 1

Must contain one of the following properties:

- reg : iomem address required

- realtek,mmio : referring to a regmap for iomem

Optional Properties of Clock Gate Controller :

- ignore-unused-clocks: shall contain a list of strings with clk_name in the
                        contoller, if a clock is in the list, the
                        CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flags will be applied to the clock.

- ignore-pm-clocks: shall contain a list of strings with clk_name in the
                    contoller, if a clock is in the list, the clock will not
                    be managed in pm callbacks.

- has-write-en -or- realtek,hse-web: an bool property which indicates the
                                     controller to setup the gate clock with
                                     using write-en bit located in (gate_bit+1)

- clock-output-names: shall contain a list of strings of the clock name, to
                      be created. For those name with prefix 'unused', it
                      won't be created.

Example:

	cc: clock-controlller@98000000 {
		compatible   = "realtek,clock-controller";
		reg = <0x98000000 0x600>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		realtek,mmio = <&crt_mmio 0x0>;
	};

	tcc: tee-clocks {
		compatible   = "realtek,tee-clock-controller";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
	};

	ce1: clk-en@9800000c {
		compatible   = "realtek,clock-gate-controller";
		reg = <0x9800000c 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		realtek,cgc,id = <0>;
		realtek,mmio = <&crt_mmio 0xc>;
	};

Example:

	device {
		clocks = <&cc CC_PLL_SCPU>, <&ce1 CLK_EN_GPU>;
	};
