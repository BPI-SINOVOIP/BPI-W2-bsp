Realtek CPU Driver DT-bindings
==============================

DVFS node (platform device node)
-------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only any of the following:
	"realtek,rtd129x-dvfs",
	"realtek,rtd139x-dvfs",
	"realtek,cpu-dvfs",
	"realtek,dummy-dvfs".

CPU node
--------

When using the dummy cpufreq driver, please put the following properties in the DVFS node.

- OPP binding:
  See also 'Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt'

  Only support for operating-points-v2.

- CPU Cooling Dev binding (optional):
  See also 'Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt'

- Clock binding:
  See also 'Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/cpu.txt'

- Regulator binding (optional):
  See also 'Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt'

Exmaple:
	cpus {
		cpu@0 {
			clocks = <&cc CC_PLL_SCPU>;
                        cpu-supply = <&cpu_supp>;
			operating-points-v2 = <&cpu_opps>;
			cooling-min-level = <0>;
			cooling-max-level = <11>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>; /* min followed by max */
		};
	};

	cpu_opps: opp-table-0 {
		...
	};

	dvfs {
		compatible = "realtek,rtk129x-dvfs";
	};
