Realtek Bus DFS DT-bindings
===========================

BUSFreq node
------------

Required properties :

- compatible : shall contain the following :
	"realtek,busfreq".

- operating-points-v2 : a phandle to a operating-points-v2.

- clocks : a phandle to bus clock

- devfreq-events: one or more phandles to devfreq event device(s).

- method: shall contain a string,
	"ltl" for long term load calculator,
	"passive" for passive.

- devfreq: only required when method is "passive", a phandle of a reference
	devfreq device.

Optional propertise :

- ltl-data: data for ltl governor


Bandwith Event node
-------------------

Required properties :

- compatible:  shall contain the following :
	"realtek,bw-event-dcsys", for a dcsys event,
	"realtek,bw-event-dmc", for a dmc event,

	and a fixed 2nd compatible

	"devfreq-event".

- perfcnts: shall contain a phandle to a perfcnt.


Example :

	event0: dcsys-bandwitdh-event {
		compatible = "realtek,bw-event-dcsys",
			"devfreq-event";
		perfcnts = <&pc0>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	event1: dmc-bandwitdh-event {
		compatible = "realtek,bw-event-dmc",
			"devfreq-event";
		perfcnts = <&pc1>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	dcsb-dfs {
		compatible = "realtek,busfreq";
		clocks = <&cc CC_PLL_DCSB>;
		devfreq-events = <&event0>, <&event1>;
		operating-points-v2 = <&dcsb_opps>;
		ltl-data = <0 0 0>;
		status = "okay";

		dcsb_opps: opp-table {
			compatible = "operating-points-v2";
			opp-low {
				opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <275000000>;
				clock-latency-ns = <150000>;
				suspend-opp;
			};
			opp-high {
				opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <550000000>;
				clock-latency-ns = <150000>;
			};
		};
	};
