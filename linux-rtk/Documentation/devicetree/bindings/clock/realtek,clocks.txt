Realtek Clock Controller
========================

Clock controller for RTD-129X/RTD-139X/RTD-16XX.

--------------
Clock Provider
--------------

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:

	"realtek,clock-controller" for Clock Controller
	"realtek,clock-gate-controller" for Clock Gate Controller

- #clock-cells : shall contain 1

Must contain one of the following properties:

- reg : iomem address required

- realtek,mmio : referring to a regmap for iomem

Optional Properties of Clock Controller

- invalid-clocks: shall contain a list of strings with clk_name in controller to indicate
	a clocks should not be initialized

Optional Properties of Clock Gate Controller :

- ignore-unused-clocks: shall contain a list of strings with clk_name in the contoller,
	if a clock is in the list, the CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flags will be applied to the
	clock.


- ignore-pm-clocks: shall contain a list of strings with clk_name in the contoller,
	if a clock is in the list, the clock will not be managed in pm callbacks.

- has-write-en: an empty property which indicates the controlller to setup the gate clock with
	using write-en bit located in (gate_bit+1). (for Thor)

Example:

	cc: clock-controlller@98000000 {
		compatible   = "realtek,clock-controller";
		reg = <0x98000000 0x600>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		realtek,mmio = <&crt_mmio 0x0>;
	};

	ce1: clk-en@9800000c {
		compatible   = "realtek,clock-gate-controller";
		reg = <0x9800000c 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		realtek,cgc,id = <0>;
		realtek,mmio = <&crt_mmio 0xc>;
	};

Clock consumer
--------------
The clock id for clock-controller/clock-gate-contoller is defined in

	dt-bindings/clock/rtk,cc-rtd129x.h,
	dt-bindings/clock/rtk,cc-rtd139x.h,
	dt-bindings/clock/rtk,clock-rtd129x.h,
	dt-bindings/clock/rtk,clock-rtd139x.h,
	dt-bindings/clock/rtk,clock-rtd16xx.h,

with a prefix 'CC_'. The clock id for clock-gate-controller is the bit index of register.

Example:

	device {
		clocks = <&cc CC_PLL_SCPU>, <&ce1 23>;
	};
