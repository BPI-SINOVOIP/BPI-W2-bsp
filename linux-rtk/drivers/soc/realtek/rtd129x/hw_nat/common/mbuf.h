						so much data in mbuf chain.
@comm  Original BSD4.4 note: Rearange an mbuf chain so that <p len> bytes are contiguous and in <p m>'s cluster.
Successing mbufs are adjusted accordingly. If the return value <p n> is smaller than requested <p len>,
maybe there isn't enough data bytes in the mbuf chain <p m>, or maybe the requested value <p len> exceeds
the maximum capacity for a single cluster.

Our implementation note:
(cfliu 2002.02.19)This function is important in traditional BSD networking stack because
original mbuf can't do dtom() if data is saved in cluster. This is not the
case here since we offer a back pointer from cluster to mbuf via cltag_mbuf field.
However, this function is still useful if we want to collect continous databytes from later clusters
to the specified mbuf's cluster. The maximum number of  <p len> should be less than a cluster
can hold (ie. len less than or equal to m_clusterSIze)

(2002.08.11) If 1) requested length <p len> is smaller than m_clusterSize, and 2) there are enough data in this mbuf chain. However, the
trailing space in <p m> is not large enough, <p mBuf_pullup> will move m's data upward first and then copy requested data from latter clusters

@devnote  This function is different from traditional BSD mbuf code. When pull up fails, the mbuf chain will not be freed,
and the return value has been changed to an integer instead of a pointer to mbuf structure.

@ex The following example demonstrates how to use this function |
	int32 n;

	n = mBuf_pullup(m, 128);
