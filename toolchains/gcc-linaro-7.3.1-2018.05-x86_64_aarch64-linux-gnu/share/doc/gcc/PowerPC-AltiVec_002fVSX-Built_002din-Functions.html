<h4 class="subsection">6.60.22 PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>GCC provides an interface for the PowerPC family of processors to access
the AltiVec operations described in Motorola&rsquo;s AltiVec Programming
Interface Manual.  The interface is made available by including
<code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> and using <samp>-maltivec</samp> and
<samp>-mabi=altivec</samp>.  The interface supports the following vector
types.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">vector unsigned char
vector signed char
vector bool char

vector unsigned short
vector signed short
vector bool short
vector pixel

vector unsigned int
vector signed int
vector bool int
vector float
</pre></div>

<p>If <samp>-mvsx</samp> is used the following additional vector types are
implemented.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">vector unsigned long
vector signed long
vector double
</pre></div>

<p>The long types are only implemented for 64-bit code generation, and
the long type is only used in the floating point/integer conversion
instructions.
</p>
<p>GCC&rsquo;s implementation of the high-level language interface available from
C and C++ code differs from Motorola&rsquo;s documentation in several ways.
</p>
<ul>
<li> A vector constant is a list of constant expressions within curly braces.

</li><li> A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of the
same type as the variable it is initializing.

</li><li> If <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code> is omitted, the signedness of the
vector type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program should
always specify the signedness.

</li><li> Compiling with <samp>-maltivec</samp> adds keywords <code>__vector</code>,
<code>vector</code>, <code>__pixel</code>, <code>pixel</code>, <code>__bool</code> and
<code>bool</code>.  When compiling ISO C, the context-sensitive substitution
of the keywords <code>vector</code>, <code>pixel</code> and <code>bool</code> is
disabled.  To use them, you must include <code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> instead.

</li><li> GCC allows using a <code>typedef</code> name as the type specifier for a
vector type.

</li><li> For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the following
does not work:

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  vec_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);
</pre></div>

<p>Since <code>vec_add</code> is a macro, the vector constant in the example
is treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
parentheses for this to work.
</p></li></ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> Only the <code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> interface is supported.
Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in
the aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are
subject to change without notice.
</p>
<p>GCC complies with the OpenPOWER 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI Specification,
which may be found at
<a href="http://openpowerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/leabi-prd/content/index.html">http://openpowerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/leabi-prd/content/index.html</a>.
Appendix A of this document lists the vector API interfaces that must be
provided by compliant compilers.  Programmers should preferentially use
the interfaces described therein.  However, historically GCC has provided
additional interfaces for access to vector instructions.  These are
briefly described below.
</p>
<p>The following interfaces are supported for the generic and specific
AltiVec operations and the AltiVec predicates.  In cases where there
is a direct mapping between generic and specific operations, only the
generic names are shown here, although the specific operations can also
be used.
</p>
<p>Arguments that are documented as <code>const int</code> require literal
integral values within the range required for that operation.

Within the result vector returned by <code>vec_extract_sig</code>, the

if the corresponding floating point value is in normalized form.

of type <code>double</code>, the <code>0x10000000000000</code> bit within each of
the result vector&rsquo;s elements is set according to the same rules.
Note that the sign of the significand is not represented in the result
returned from the <code>vec_extract_sig</code> function.  To extract the
sign bits, use the
<code>vec_cpsgn</code> function, which returns a new vector within which all
of the sign bits of its second argument vector are overwritten with the
sign bits copied from the coresponding elements of its first argument
vector, and all other (non-sign) bits of the second argument vector
are copied unchanged into the result vector.
</p>
<p>The <code>vec_insert_exp</code> built-in functions return a vector of
single- or double-precision floating
point values constructed by assembling the values of their
<code>significands</code> and <code>exponents</code> arguments into the
corresponding elements of the returned vector.
The sign of each
element of the result is copied from the most significant bit of the
corresponding entry within the <code>significands</code> argument.
Note that the relevant
bits of the <code>significands</code> argument are the same, for both integer
and floating point types.
The
significand and exponent components of each element of the result are
composed of the least significant bits of the corresponding
<code>significands</code> element and the least significant bits of the
corresponding <code>exponents</code> element.
</p>
<p>The <code>vec_test_data_class</code> built-in function returns a vector
representing the results of testing the <code>source</code> vector for the
condition selected by the <code>condition</code> argument.  The
<code>condition</code> argument must be a compile-time constant integer with
value not exceeding 127.  The
<code>condition</code> argument is encoded as a bitmask with each bit
enabling the testing of a different condition, as characterized by the
following:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">0x40    Test for NaN
0x20    Test for +Infinity
0x10    Test for -Infinity
0x08    Test for +Zero
0x04    Test for -Zero
0x02    Test for +Denormal
0x01    Test for -Denormal
</pre></div>

<p>If any of the enabled test conditions is true, the corresponding entry
in the result vector is -1.  Otherwise (all of the enabled test
conditions are false), the corresponding entry of the result vector is 0.
</p>
<p>The following built-in functions are available for the PowerPC family
of processors, starting with ISA 3.0 or later (<samp>-mcpu=power9</samp>):
</p><div class="smallexample">

                                    vector unsigned long long,
                                    vector unsigned long long);

</pre></div>

<p>The result of <code>vec_rlmi</code> is obtained by rotating each element of
the first argument vector left and inserting it under mask into the
second argument vector.  The third argument vector contains the mask
beginning in bits 11:15, the mask end in bits 19:23, and the shift
count in bits 27:31, of each element.
</p>
<p>The result of <code>vec_rlnm</code> is obtained by rotating each element of
the first argument vector left and ANDing it with a mask specified by
the second and third argument vectors.  The second argument vector
contains the shift count for each element in the low-order byte.  The
third argument vector contains the mask end for each element in the
low-order byte, with the mask begin in the next higher byte.
</p>
<p>The result of <code>vec_vrlnm</code> is obtained by rotating each element
of the first argument vector left and ANDing it with a mask.  The
second argument vector contains the mask  beginning in bits 11:15,
the mask end in bits 19:23, and the shift count in bits 27:31,
of each element.
