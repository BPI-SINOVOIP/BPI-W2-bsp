	/* 'siam' (Set Interval Arithmetic Mode) is used to quickly override
	   the rounding mode during this routine.

	   We add then subtract (or subtract than add if the initial
	   value was negative) 2**23 to the value, then subtract it
	   back out.

	   This will clear out the fractional portion of the value and,
	   with suitable 'siam' initiated rouding mode settings, round
	   the final result in the proper direction.

	   We also use VIS3 moves to avoid using the stack to transfer
	   values between float and integer registers.  */
