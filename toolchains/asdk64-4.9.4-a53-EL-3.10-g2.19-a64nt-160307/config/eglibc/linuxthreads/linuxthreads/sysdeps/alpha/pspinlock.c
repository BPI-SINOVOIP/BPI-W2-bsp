/* This implementation is similar to the one used in the Linux kernel.
   But the kernel is byte instructions for the memory access.  This is
   faster but unusable here.  The problem is that only 128
   threads/processes could use the spinlock at the same time.  If (by
   a design error in the program) a thread/process would hold the
   spinlock for a time long enough to accumulate 128 waiting
   processes, the next one will find a positive value in the spinlock
   and assume it is unlocked.  We cannot accept that.  */
